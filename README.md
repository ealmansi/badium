# Toptal Blockchain Specialization: Test Project

## Description

Create a smart contract for a new ERC20 token called Badium (BAD). Deploy the contract to testnet before the interview.

## Requirements

The token must have the following characteristics:

* An initial total supply of 10,000,000.
* A buying cost of 0.01 ETH per BAD.
* The owner can burn all tokens at any time.
* The owner can mint arbitrary amount of tokens at any time.
* The owner can transfer tokens from one address to another.
* The owner can specify and modify a list of eligible receivers. Once bought by users, tokens can be transferred only to those addresses.

Note: Whatever parameters are not defined in the task are left for you to decide on your own, while making sure they benefit the contract's architecture.
